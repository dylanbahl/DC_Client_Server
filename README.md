# DC_Client_Server

This is my first run-in with GitHub, apologies if I messed it up. These are a java client and server designed to run on the same system. The client messages the server, receives the time, and prints it then closes. The server accepts the client's request, gives it the time, then closes the connection. The java files are in the src folder.
